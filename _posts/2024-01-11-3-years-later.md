# 3 years later...

If you're reading this, that means I successfully re-learned how to update this little corner of the internet. Hooray!

Okay. A lot's happened in my 3-year absence.
- In December 2021, I graduated from university.
- In February 2022, I joined Microsoft full-time.
- In October 2022, I got promoted.
- In April 2023, I was re-orged into the Copilot team.
- In October 2023, I was laid off.

So we're back at square one for now. The good deal is that I have time to learn whatever techy thing I want to now, and have the opportunity to look for new opportunities.
The bad deal is that it's time to hop back on the LeetCode grind. (Where "bad" = a combination of pressure, stress, and the opposite of excitement, I suppose.)

The first thing I want to do is what you are reading now: get this thing back up and running. I like learning things, and I like writing notes, because my human memory is limited.

I was up till 2am reading SIGBOVIK papers last night. I want to write down the things I find interesting about each one, because I think I will enjoy looking back on the notes years later.

I guess `full-stop` has come full-circle for now. I'll keep sharpening my skills and getting ready for the next thing. 


And above all, I am grateful to be here, and grateful for everything I've learnt and gotten to experience so far. The adventure continues!
