Hello.

This blog uses a revived version of the [Naringu](https://github.com/ariestiyansyah/naringu) theme for Jekyll. I chose it because I like markdown and dark mode.

It required a bit of work out of the box (last update was 2015-ish), but I think I figured it out.

I'm hoping to put notes about things I'm learning here. I have some old notes about [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and how I triple-booted a 2011 Macbook Air. I figured it'd be nice to publish them somewhere, in the off-chance that someone else in the world has the same niche curiosity.

Test post complete.
